First of All,I download the CS website along all files(php, htm, css, imgs, pdf).
i changed the php files into html files.
The website was written using Bootstrap CSS frameword, a remove that link and write custom css for that.
After that i start formating the html code, i create Grids and Flex for responsiveness and layout.
For responsiveness, I use media Queries also.
The image slider on home page was challenging,
but then I figured out how to do this, actually i have used transitions and translation.
I am further looking to improve the slider( to add next and prevoius button using css).
